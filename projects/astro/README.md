# Astro JS Boilerplate
This is a boilerplate configured and ready to go for developing a web application using [Astro](https://astro.build/).
It includes a basic configuration with [ESLint](https://eslint.org) for code linting and [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting. 

ESlint is configured to run with the [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/#typescript) ruleset with TypeScript support.
Astro comes by default with [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) support.

To run the project, just clone the repository and run `pnpm install` and then `pnpm run dev`. Update dependencies versions as needed.
